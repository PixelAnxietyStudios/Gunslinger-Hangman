# Gunslinger-Hangman
Hangman project submission for Hackman 2022
This is a hangman style game but with a western twist!
It uses the desired API set up by Jay to get a word and use it for the game
A user can play the game by pressing play when the app lauches. 
Then they can select letters on the right hand side to try to solve the word.
The enemy has 6 bullets before they succesfully shoot you, so make sure you get the word correct before then!

All the source code is under the gile "Gunslinger hangman"
